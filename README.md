**Project Title:** Parallel Merge Sort Algorithm

**Description:**
This project implements a parallelized sorting algorithm based on the merge sort technique within the domain of concurrent and distributed programming. Leveraging Java's Fork/Join framework, the algorithm efficiently sorts arrays of integers by dividing, sorting, and merging subarrays concurrently, thus harnessing the computational power of multi-core processors. The codebase includes classes for parallel and sequential merge sort implementations, along with test cases and a step-by-step representation of the sorting process. The project aims to address challenges in concurrency, optimize performance, and demonstrate real-world applications of parallel sorting algorithms.

**Key Features:**
- Parallelized merge sort algorithm using Java's Fork/Join framework
- Sequential merge sort implementation for comparison and fallback
- Test cases for validating algorithm functionality with various input scenarios
- Step-by-step representation of the sorting process for educational purposes

**Technologies Used:** Java, Fork/Join framework, Concurrent and Distributed Programming principles
