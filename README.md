**Title:** Thread Management in Java: Complex vs Basic Threads

**Description:**
This repository explores thread management in Java, contrasting the behavior of complex threads with basic threads and illustrating the impact on memory usage.

**Complex Threads:**
In the `ComplexThread` class, we delve into the creation of threads that perform computationally intensive tasks. These threads continuously access and modify a large array, simulating complex processing scenarios. As a result, they consume significant amounts of memory and can lead to out-of-memory errors if not managed carefully.

**Basic Threads:**
On the other hand, the `MyThreads` class demonstrates the creation of basic threads that perform simple tasks. These threads execute a lightweight loop, printing messages to the console, and typically consume minimal memory. However, spawning too many basic threads can also exhaust system resources and trigger out-of-memory errors.

**Memory Management:**
The main methods in both classes showcase a memory management approach where threads are created dynamically until an out-of-memory error occurs. This approach helps to understand the system's limitations and provides insights into the scalability of thread creation.

**Usage Examples:**
To observe the behavior of these threads, run the `ComplexThread` and `MyThreads` classes. Keep an eye on the console output and observe how memory usage evolves as threads are created. The `OutOfMemoryError` message indicates when the system runs out of memory resources, providing valuable feedback on thread management strategies.

**Conclusion:**
By exploring complex and basic threads in Java, developers gain insights into memory management and resource utilization in multi-threaded applications. Understanding the implications of thread creation on system resources is crucial for designing scalable and efficient concurrent systems.
