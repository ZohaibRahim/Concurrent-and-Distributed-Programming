**Title:** Semaphore-Based File Access in Java

**Description:**
This repository contains a Java implementation of semaphore-based file access, demonstrating how to manage concurrent access to a limited number of files using semaphores.

**SemaphoreExample Class:**
The `SemaphoreExample` class serves as the entry point of the application. It spawns multiple threads, each representing a task that needs to access shared files. The number of threads is defined by the `threads` constant.

**sharedFile Class:**
The `sharedFile` class encapsulates the logic for file access using semaphores. It maintains a fixed number of files (`files`) and utilizes a semaphore to control access to these files. The semaphore ensures that only a limited number of threads can access the files simultaneously, preventing contention and resource conflicts.

**File Access Logic:**
The `accessFiles` method simulates file access operations performed by each thread. It acquires a permit from the semaphore before accessing a file and releases the permit after completing the operation. Each thread generates random numbers, performs arithmetic operations, and writes the results to a designated file. This process demonstrates how semaphores can synchronize access to shared resources in a multi-threaded environment.

**Concurrency Control:**
The semaphore (`semaphore`) is initialized with the number of available files, ensuring that no more than a specified number of threads can access the files concurrently. This mechanism helps manage resource contention and prevents data corruption or race conditions during file access operations.

**Usage:**
To observe the semaphore-based file access in action, run the `SemaphoreExample` class. The application will spawn multiple threads, each performing arithmetic operations and writing the results to corresponding files. Monitor the output files to see the results of the concurrent file access operations and observe how the semaphore controls access to shared resources.

**Conclusion:**
By employing semaphores for concurrency control, developers can ensure safe and efficient access to shared resources in multi-threaded applications. This repository provides a practical example of semaphore usage for file access synchronization, demonstrating the benefits of proper synchronization techniques in concurrent programming.
