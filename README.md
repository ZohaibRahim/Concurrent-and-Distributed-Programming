**Title:** Custom Lock Implementations in Java

**Description:**
This code is showcasing custom lock implementations! Here, you'll find two types of locks: basic locks and reentrant locks, designed to help manage concurrency in your Java applications.

**Basic Locks:**
In the `CustomBasicLock` class, we've created a simple yet effective locking mechanism using synchronized methods. Threads can use this lock to protect critical sections of code, ensuring that only one thread accesses them at a time. This prevents data corruption and maintains the integrity of shared resources.

**Reentrant Locks:**
The `CustomReentrantLock` class introduces a more advanced concept: reentrant locks. Unlike basic locks, reentrant locks allow a thread to acquire the lock multiple times without running into deadlocks. This flexibility is incredibly useful in complex multi-threaded scenarios where a thread may need to re-enter a critical section it already holds.

**Usage Examples:**
To see these locks in action, check out the `BasicLockMain` and `ReentrantMain` classes. They demonstrate how threads interact with our custom lock implementations, acquiring and releasing locks to safely access shared resources.
